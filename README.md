## 🔍 Heart Disease Prediction  
**Source:** Dataquest  

**Summary:**  
This project involves analysing a heart disease dataset to build a predictive model using the **K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN)** algorithm. It includes key steps such as data imputation, feature selection, and hyperparameter tuning. The model aims to identify individuals at risk of heart disease based on clinical and demographic variables.

## 🧮 Credit Card Customer Segmentation  
**Source:** Dataquest  

**Summary:**  
This project focuses on customer segmentation using unsupervised learning techniques. By applying clustering algorithms such as KMeans, credit card users are grouped based on behavioural features. The objective is to uncover meaningful customer segments that could inform business and marketing strategies.

**Dashboard Insight:**  
A Power BI dashboard was developed to visualise key patterns in the original dataset prior to clustering. It provides interactive visual summaries of customer profiles, expenditure habits, and feature distributions to support initial exploratory analysis and stakeholder communication.
